# âš¡ Poke API Client

This repository contains a small client for the poke api using flask in the back and tailwind as a css styling framework. 
This practice was created in order to hone my skills as a full stack developer, the decision to use python as a project base
was due to the fact that I have found some interesting jobs whose requirements include flask.

## Instructions to run this project locally.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evilelliot/poke-api-client.git
2. Create and activate a venv environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv poke-api
   poke-api/Scripts/activate
3. Install python dependencies from requiremnts.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Install js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i -y
5. Run flask dev server:
   ```bash
   python ./main.py
